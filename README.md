# Sacrifice
My first graded UE4 project.

Almost all of the scripting, other than UI-related stuff, is done through C++.

This game is based off the Sacrifice game type from Halo 3.

The goal is push all other vehicles off of the arena. You gain a point for being the last one standing, as well as for every vehicle you destroy.
